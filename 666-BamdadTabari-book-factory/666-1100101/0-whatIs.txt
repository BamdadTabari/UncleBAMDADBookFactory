hello.

I'm Uncle Bamdad.

I wanna something different.

something behind your mind.

I want convert myself to a computer program.

this book is the basic data of 1100101 project.

Is it possible? 
    yes, nothing is impossible

am I creazy?
    yes

Is it possible to die in this way?
    yes

am I on drugs?
    always

what is the plan?
    OOP Concept.
    everything is an object.
    also me.
    I have not enough knowlege.
    so, first I should build an instance of myself in computer.
    how?! 
    it's simple.
    you know chatbot's.
    AI machines that learn when they talk to you.
    if I want to do 1100101 project by myself. it's take along time and money.
    so. first I build my AI character, same parameters, same methods.
    same belife and then,
    instead of talking to my self,
    I will talk to my AI character.
    It will take time to build it.
    but it is worth doing.
    enough talking. 
    lets go for it.
