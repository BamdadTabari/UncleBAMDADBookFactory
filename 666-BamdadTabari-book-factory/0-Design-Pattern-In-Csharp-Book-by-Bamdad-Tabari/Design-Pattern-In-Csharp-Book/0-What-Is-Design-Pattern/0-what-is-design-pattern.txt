Design Pattern:
design patterns are like pre-made blueprints that developers can customize 
to solve recurring design problems in their code efficiently. 
They provide a common language for communication among team members 
and offer structured solutions to common software design challenges.
A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem 
in software design. 
It provides a structured approach to solving specific issues that developers 
face during the development process. 

Here are key points about design patterns based on my search results:

1. Best Practices: Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers to solve general problems encountered during software development.
2. Gang of Four (GOF): The term "Gang of Four" refers to the authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who published the book "Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" in 1994. They are known for their significant contributions to design patterns and object-oriented design principles.
3. Types of Design Patterns: Design patterns can be classified into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. Additionally, there are J2EE design patterns specifically focused on the presentation tier.
- Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation and provide flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
- Structural Patterns: Concerned with class and object composition, these patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects for new functionalities.
- Behavioral Patterns: Specifically address communication between objects and how they interact with each other during runtime.
4. Benefits of Design Patterns:
- Design patterns speed up the development process by providing tested and proven development paradigms.
- They prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improve code readability.
- Design patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known names for software interactions.
5. Flexibility and Reusability: Design patterns enhance code flexibility by promoting loose coupling between components and providing proven solutions to common problems. They also contribute to code maintainability during team collaboration by establishing a common vocabulary and structure.
