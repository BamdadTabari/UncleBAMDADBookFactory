* Describe The Abstract Factory Design pattern in C# with Details And C# Code Sample :

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C# is a creational pattern that allows the creation of entire families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes directly. Here are the key details and a code sample in C#:

### Details:
- Abstract Factory: Defines an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Concrete Factories: Implement the abstract factory interface to create specific instances of objects within a family.
- Abstract Products: Declare an interface for a type of product object.
- Concrete Products: Implement the abstract product interface to define specific product objects created by concrete factories.
- Client: Utilizes the abstract factory to create families of objects without knowing their concrete types, enabling easy switching between different object types.

### Code Sample in C#:
```csharp
// Step 1: Create an interface for Styles
public interface IStyles {
    void DesignPhilosophy();
    void BuildMaterials();
}

// Step 2: Create concrete classes implementing the Styles interface
public class ClassicCabinet : IStyles {
    public void DesignPhilosophy() {
        Console.WriteLine("This style inspiration from English and French styles...");
    }
    public void BuildMaterials() {
        Console.WriteLine("This style build by oak, cherry, walnut...");
    }

// Step 3: Create an Abstract Factory interface
public interface IStyleFactory {
    IStyles CreateClassic();
    IStyles CreateContemporary();
    IStyles CreateScandinavian();
}

// Step 4: Create Concrete Factory classes implementing the IStyleFactory
public class CabinetFactory : IStyleFactory {
    public IStyles CreateClassic() {
        return new ClassicCabinet();
    }
    // Implement CreateContemporary and CreateScandinavian similarly

// Step 5: Client code to use the factories and products
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        IStyleFactory factory = new CabinetFactory();

        // Get an object of Classic Cabinet
        IStyles classicCabinet = factory.CreateClassic();
        classicCabinet.DesignPhilosophy();
        classicCabinet.BuildMaterials();
    }
}
```

This pattern is useful when creating families of related objects where the client code needs to work with different object types without knowing their concrete classes. It provides flexibility in switching between different object families by changing the concrete factory instance.
