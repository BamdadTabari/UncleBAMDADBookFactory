the row Django files structure:

note=>
Understanding these components is vital for maintaining a well-organized, scalable, 
and maintainable Django project structure. 
By leveraging these elements effectively, developers can build robust web applications efficiently.

The Django file structure is a fundamental aspect of developing web applications with Django, 
providing a robust foundation for efficient development. 
Here is a detailed breakdown of the key components within the Django file structure:

1. Project Structure
- Manage.py: 
A command-line utility for managing various aspects of your Django project.

- Settings.py: 
Contains the Django project configuration, including the Django settings for the project.

- Urls.py: 
Handles all the URLs of the web application, mapping URL patterns to views.

- Asgi.py & Wsgi.py: 
Entry points for serving Django applications 
using 
ASGI (for asynchronous and real-time applications) 
or WSGI (for traditional web servers like Apache and Nginx).

- Templates Directory: 
Stores HTML templates used for generating dynamic content in web applications.

- Static Directory: 
Stores static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc., served directly to users.

2. App Structure
- Init.py: 
Provides the same functionality as the `__init__.py` file in the Django project structure. 
It remains empty and is present just to indicate that the specific app directory is a package.

- Admin.py: 
Used for registering the Django models into the Django administration.

- Apps.py: 
Used to help the user include the application configuration for their app.

- Models.py: 
Represents the models of web applications in the form of classes. 
It defines the structure of the database.

- Views.py: 
Provides an interface through which a user interacts with a Django web application. 
It contains all the views in the form of classes.

- Urls.py: 
Works the same as the `urls.py` in the project file structure.

- Tests.py: 
Mainly concerns with the WSGI server and is used to test the working of the application.
